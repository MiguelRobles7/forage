The interior decor is charming and cozy, perfect for unwinding with a cup of coffee. Speaking of coffee, their brews are a delight to the taste buds.

    "title": "The Worst Matcha Latte",
    "body": "I recently had the unfortunate experience of trying Coffee Time's Matcha Latte, and I must say, it was a disappointment. The matcha flavor was incredibly weak, almost nonexistent. It tasted more like a regular milk latte with a hint of artificial sweetness. The texture was thin and watery, lacking the creamy richness that a good matcha latte should have. It seemed like they used low-quality matcha powder, as there was a noticeable bitterness that lingered unpleasantly. Overall, I would not recommend Coffee Time's Matcha Latte if you're looking for an authentic and satisfying matcha experience.",
